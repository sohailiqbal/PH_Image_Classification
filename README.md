This project leverages topological data analysis (TDA) using persistent homology to extract features from data, aiming to classify images effectively. The package uses Ripser to compute persistent homology but can achieve faster computation times with Ripser++ if large datasets are involved.

Installation
To use this code, ensure you have MATLAB installed with Python support, and install the necessary Python libraries:

Install Ripser for Python:
pip install ripser
Install any other dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Usage for Covid-19 classification: Setting Up Data: Place COVID and Non-COVID images in the Data/Covid and Data/NonCovid folders, respectively.
Running the Code: Run the main MATLAB script to compute persistent homology features and classify images.

Cross-Validation: The code uses 5-fold cross-validation, with each fold dynamically sized to 20% of the dataset, making the code adaptable to any dataset size. Note: Transductive approaches (like this one) require more RAM compared to inductive methods since they process both training and test data.
