Requirements for matlab
MATLAB Requirements for Persistent Homology Image Classification Project

1. MATLAB Toolboxes:
   - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
     - Required for functions like fitcsvm, PCA, and other machine learning tasks.
   - Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional)
     - Speeds up large computations, especially useful for parallel processing.

2. External MATLAB Libraries:
   - JavaPlex (optional): MATLAB library for computing persistent homology.
     - Installation: https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex
     - Usage: Add to path using `load_javaplex` and `import edu.stanford.math.plex4.*`

   - Ripser (Python): Required for persistent homology computations via Python.
     - Ensure MATLAB is configured with Python. Check Python configuration with:
       ```matlab
       pyversion
       ```
     - Install `ripser` and `numpy` in the selected Python environment.

3. Additional External MATLAB Files:
   - libsvm-3.21: Support Vector Machine library for specific configurations.
     - Installation: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
   - Sphere Tools: Provides functions for spherical data handling, like `sphere_extrinsic_mean` and `log_map`.
     - Download link: https://github.com/rushilanirudh/pdsphere/tree/master/matlab

4. Adding Paths:
   - Ensure `libsvm-3.21` and `Sphere tools` directories are added to the MATLAB path. Use:
     ```matlab
     addpath(genpath('libsvm-3.21'));
     addpath(genpath('Sphere tools'));
     ```
